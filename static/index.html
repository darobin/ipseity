      <h1>Interplanetary Standards</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of <em>Interplanetary Standards</em> is to foster interoperability between independent implementations of parts of
        the interplanetary stack (IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, Multiformats) by producing Internet-grade specifications and test suites.

        <h3>High-quality open standards</h3>
        <p>
          We aim to fully define implementation behaviour and to empower anyone to build their
          own system that fits into the interplanetary ecosystem without needing to reverse-engineer
          the behavior of other implementations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pitch">
        <h3>Comprehensive test suites</h3>
        <p>
          A specification is only as useful as it is both testable and tested. We are building extensive
          test suites that allow specifications to prove their interoperability and implementations to demonstrate
          their correctness.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pitch">
        <h3>Testing infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
          We build tools to support detecting interoperability issues early and often as part of CI/CD pipelines
          and to report on implementation maturity as the stack evolves so that people who build on top of the
          interplanetary stack can know what they can use in production.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pitch">
        <h3>An open governance model</h3>
        <p>
          We guarantee community ownership of the standards, of the standards-production process, and of
          the infrastructure to operate it, in collective pursuit of efficient, transformative, ethical
          technology.

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <p>
        The specifications are broken up into multiple areas that cover the entirety of the stack. Each
        area may have different governance arrangements so as to ensure that it runs in the way that is
        the most appropriate for that community, but all must follow the governance set for the overall
        project.
