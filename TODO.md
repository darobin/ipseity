## For The Specs

From @aschmahmann:
* Overall problem:
    * https://github.com/ipfs/specs as a whole slew of documents that should be removed/archived as not being real specs (keychain, keystore, mfs, repo, ...) or being horribly out of date.
* Specs with big problems:
    * UnixFS specs aren't good enough to build an implementation out of
    * There is no IPFS DHT spec, there's a libp2p one https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht, but all of the IPFS-specific pieces are either missing or hidden in the libp2p spec
* Pet peeve:
    * Spec documents where things unrelated to the spec such as implementation details, alternatives considered, etc. and the spec are intertwined such that they're hard to distinguish. I personally prefer specs just being specs, but if people want these other artifacts around then having them sufficiently separate would be great. The UnixFS spec is particularly bad at this.
